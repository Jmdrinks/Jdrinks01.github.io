## Hobbies
I personally enjoy playing videogames during my freetime I'm always on the lookout for a new videogame that peaks my interest. If I'm not on the lookout then I'm binge watching a show. The show I'm currently watching is "How to get away with murder" I'm enjoying that show a lot more than I anticipated.
My favorite artist is Jermiane Cole something about his music is just different it tells a story and a lesson a prime example of a song like that is '03 Adolescence another song I enjoy is his song Change.
